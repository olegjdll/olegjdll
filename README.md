## About me
Data Engineer with over 5 years of experience designing and operating data-intensive solutions on cloud platforms such as Azure, Databricks, and Snowflake, and leveraging open-source tools and programming languages like Python, SQL, and C# to build custom analytical platforms and high-performance data processing systems. Skilled at translating stakeholder needs into robust technical solutions, I specialize in data architecture, performance optimization, ETL pipelines, and advanced data management.

I have experience collaborating with teams of all sizes, ranging from small agile groups to large cross-functional teams. My expertise includes building and optimizing analytical workloads for high performance and scalability, developing data-intensive software, auditing systems, providing cross-disciplinary consulting, implementing CI/CD pipelines, and managing cloud infrastructure.

Beyond my core responsibilities, I present tech talks at conferences, publish articles on data architecture and advanced data management on my blog, and mentor aspiring data engineers and backend developers. Additionally, I lectured on SQL at Inha University in Tashkent.
